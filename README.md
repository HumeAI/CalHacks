# Cal Hacks 10.0 | Hume AI

## Hume AI

Hume provides the AI toolkit to measure, understand, and improve how technology affects human emotion. Our algorithms understand nuanced speech prosody, vocal bursts, facial expression, and tone of language—which, integrated into large language models, will determine how people experience the future of AI. Our APIs can process video, audio, images, or text and can be integrated with LLMs to build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more.
