## Hume AI

Hume provides the AI toolkit to measure, understand, and improve how technology affects human emotion. Our algorithms understand nuanced speech prosody, vocal bursts, facial expression, and tone of language—which, integrated into large language models, will determine how people experience the future of AI. Our APIs can process video, audio, images, or text and can be integrated with LLMs to build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more.

## Sample Projects

Below are a list of example projects in Python and NodeJS for reference to jumpstart your project development. Visit the `#built-with-hume` channel in the Community section of our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/WPRSugvAm6) for more reference code!

**Python**

- [Expressions Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/HumeAI/expressive-prompt-engineering/tree/main) | _Developed by our research team, this project is a solution for enhancing LLM prompts with expression via Hume APIs. ChatGPT and OpenAI language embeddings are also integrated to enable deeper experimentation._

- [Humechat](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/humechat) | _Sample project which usees OpenAPI with Hume AI. Also includes an example of how to stringify Hume API expression predictions with OpenAPI._

**NodeJS**

- [Hume Raw Text Processor](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/hume-raw-text-processor) | _Sample project on processing raw text with Hume's Batch API. Implements polling for a job status before fetching predictions with exponential backoff._

- [Sandbox](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/sandbox) | _Provides a sample on how to use Hume's Streaming API with your webcam and mic._
